Description
<br>
A sample of my previous work loads in an online portfolio.
<br>
My name is presented and links to sections about myself, my work, and how to contact me is available when you click one of the links in the navigation. 
<br>
The UI scrolls to the corresponding section when you click on the link to the section about my work. 
<br>
The UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my first application. 
<br>
My first application's image is larger in size than the others.
<br>
When you click on the image of the application then it takes you to the deployed application.
<br>
When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices then you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
